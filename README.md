# PUI-hw5-issue-re-upload
HW6A Updates Here
## Deliverables
[InVision Link](https://projects.invisionapp.com/prototype/ck0udh7lz0030we0178ca3nly/play) - The updated hi-fi screens 

[Lo-Fi Sketches](https://documentcloud.adobe.com/link/track?uri=urn:aaid:scds:US:1acffbaf-d3f2-4985-96ed-23891c565eaa) - The draft updated features 

## Features Added
1. Click thumbnails to display img in slideshow in product detail page
2. Slideshow changes when clicked at different glazing options
3. Cart item amount indicator is updated
4. A dummy cart page is added - but fully functional on its own: you can edit the amount and the total price will be updated
5. Oh, and please add *Blueberry Rolls* - haven't finished other item pages yet

## Notes
The cart page is currently with dummy rows - it does not reflect the items you added. I'll update those in assignment partB.
